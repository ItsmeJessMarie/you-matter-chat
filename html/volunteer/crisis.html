          <p>
            Please read through each point to make sure you fully understand
            what is involved before submitting an application to become a Crisis
            Responder with YouMatter. It is important you follow all steps,
            regardless of your professional background. If you have any
            questions, please contact us via our website before applying.
          </p>
          <div class="requirement-information">
            <h2>Requirements:</h2>
            <p>
              You can volunteer from anywhere in the world, however you need to
              have a stable internet connection and access to a personal
              computer to log into our systems. All your shifts must be
              conducted in a private space, away from distractions or other
              people that can see your screen. You will volunteer for a minimum
              of two hours every week and agree that you can commit to a minimum
              term of volunteering, usually one year. We strive to offer an
              around the clock service, however, we cannot guarantee Crisis
              Responder hours and you might need to take shifts at varying times
              to ensure you meet your hours each week. You will be required to
              obtain, and self-fund, a local criminal background check. You must
              disclose any criminal convictions or cautions during your
              application process. All appointments are subject to background
              checks and references being obtained. Crisis Responders are
              voluntary positions and you will not be paid for any work
              undertaken with YouMatter. You understand that we cannot reimburse
              any costs, such as the purchase of computers or background checks.
            </p>
            <h2>Training:</h2>
            <p>
              We encourage applications from a range of both personal and
              professional backgrounds. Regardless of what you're bringing to
              our team, everyone is required to undertake our in-house crisis
              intervention training course in order to become certified in the
              intervention we deploy across the YouMatter service. Training will
              be completed remotely and on the applicants own time. You can use
              our professional qualification to show to friends and family, or
              even an employer! Following our core training program, you will
              have to go through an exam, alongside mock chats before being
              approved to start answering live crisis support calls through our
              chat software.
            </p>
            <h2>Reality:</h2>
            <p>
              While this work can be incredibly rewarding, it is important you
              understand the reality of talking to people in crisis. Crisis
              Responders will take chats from people experiencing a suicide
              crisis, and may be the last person a chatter speaks with before
              ending their lives. You understand that we cannot send medical
              assistance for those that attempt to, or end their lives. You will
              talk to people who have experienced, or perpetrated abuse of all
              natures. We might not be able to report crimes that have, or will,
              take place. We talk to people at their worst and may not know the
              outcome of those situations. You will talk to people from across
              the globe, who might be facing a range of different social and
              economic problems. Chatters may hold their own beliefs and values
              and we are here to respect those. You are not permitted to give
              chatters advice of any kind and are simply here to listen.
            </p>
            <h2>Progression:</h2>
            <p>
              YouMatter offers a range of progression and development
              opportunities for those seeking to expand and grow. All our shifts
              are staffed by trained, certified Supervisors. We are constantly
              growing our reach, so keen to develop regional leaders to support
              us in this development. You are given ongoing training and
              development opportunities, alongside the opportunity to join a
              supportive community of people who are all driven by the same
              values to provide support to those in need.

                We are growing fast and looking to recruit Crisis Intervention

                experience working within leadership roles. External Supervisor
                applicants are sill required to go through the same application
                process as Responders; you can indicate on your application that
                you are interested in taking on a Supervisory role.
